## Safety

- Education and tooling, not financial advice. A PASS from `/nse-risk` is a rules check, not a recommendation.
- Paper trading by default (`"paper": true`). `/nse-paper` records practice trades on real prices; nothing
  in this pack sends an order to Zerodha. Going live is the user's own decision, in their own config.
- A broker skill on Zerodha's Kite MCP may come later. Even then it will place an order only after
  `/nse-risk` passed that exact order today and the user typed an explicit yes for it in the chat, with
  the order tool set to "Needs approval", never "Always allow".
- No options, futures, margin, short selling or leverage unless the config allows it and the user confirms.
- Broker keys and Kite access tokens live in environment variables or the Claude Desktop config, never in the chat.
